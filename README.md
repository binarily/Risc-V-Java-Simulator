# Risc-V-Java-Simulator
A simulator for RISC-V instruction sets

Forked due to the fact branch history does not allow pull requests. 

## Usage

The simulator accepts binary files that contain RISC-V 32-bit instructions. The simulator should accept RV64I (integer) and RV64M (multiplication) instructions with the exception of instructions that take words as arguments (as they would require 64-bit instructions). These instructions may operate on 2001-byte memory - its size can be changed in Memory.java file. 

## About
